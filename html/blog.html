                            <p>The IT job market in Bangladesh is currently highly competitive. Every year, thousands of
                                new IT engineers enter the job market. However, due to a lack of sufficient jobs and
                                opportunities, many fail to find work that matches their skills. As a result, many IT
                                engineers are either working for low pay or are unable to secure positions that align
                                with their expertise.
                                <br><br>
                                In this challenging scenario, Japan could be a game-changer. Japan is currently facing a
                                significant shortage of IT engineers and is actively seeking skilled foreign
                                professionals to contribute to its technology sector. This opens up an incredible
                                opportunity for Bangladeshi IT engineers. <br><br>

                                Why Does Japan Hold Opportunities for You? <br>
                                Japan has a low number of IT engineers and a high demand for skilled workers. According
                                to the Japanese government, there will be a shortage of approximately 790,000 IT
                                engineers by 2030. This has made Japanese companies increasingly open to hiring foreign
                                talent. <br><br>

                                This presents a golden opportunity for skilled IT professionals from Bangladesh. With
                                the growing demand for IT professionals in Japan, many Bangladeshi engineers can
                                capitalize on this chance. <br><br>

                                Bangladesh vs. Japan: Salary and Opportunities <br>
                                Let’s talk about one of the most important aspects—salary. In Bangladesh, a mid-level IT
                                engineer earns an average annual salary of $6,000 to $10,000. However, in Japan, the
                                same position can offer an annual salary ranging from $40,000 to $70,000, with even
                                better benefits such as health insurance, housing, and bonuses. <br>
                                This means that by working in Japan, you can earn significantly more while enjoying an
                                improved standard of living compared to Bangladesh. <br><br>


                                What Skills Are Needed to Succeed in Japan? <br>
                                It is crucial to understand the skills Japanese companies are looking for. Here are some
                                of the key areas where Japanese companies are particularly interested: <br><br>
                                • Software Development: Proficiency in languages like Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript.
                                <br>
                                • AI and Machine Learning: Expertise in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning
                                technologies. <br>
                                • Cloud Computing: Experience with platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
                                <br>
                                • Cybersecurity: Specialization in ensuring cybersecurity. <br>
                                • Robotics and IoT: Skills in new technologies and robotics. <br>

                                In addition to these technical skills, learning the Japanese language can be a major
                                advantage. While some companies operate in English, knowing Japanese will open up more
                                opportunities, helping you communicate better, integrate with the company culture, and
                                advance your career. <br><br>

                                Why Is Learning Japanese Important? <br>
                                Learning Japanese is a big step toward working in Japan. While some companies do operate
                                in English, knowing Japanese gives you a competitive edge. It not only makes
                                professional life easier but also enhances your personal life by helping you adapt to
                                Japanese society. <br>
                                Though learning a new language takes time, it is an investment that will never go to
                                waste. It will boost your confidence, help you land your dream job, and allow you to see
                                life from a new perspective. <br><br>


                                How to Get Started? <br>
                                1. Learn Japanese: Start learning through apps like Duolingo or Memrise. Institutions
                                like MAT Services BD also offer specialized language courses for IT professionals.
                                <br>
                                2. Improve Technical Skills: Focus on upgrading your skills in areas like AI,
                                cybersecurity, and cloud computing. Consider taking certification courses to make
                                yourself more competitive in Japan’s job market. <br>
                                3. Connect with Japanese Companies: Start looking for job postings on platforms like
                                GaijinPot Jobs, Jobs in Japan, or LinkedIn. <br>
                                4. Network: Connect with people who are already working in Japan or planning to go
                                there. They can provide valuable insights and guidance about jobs and life in Japan.
                                <br><br>


                                Final Words: Are You Ready? <br>
                                The opportunity to work in Japan is not something to miss. By acquiring the right skills
                                and learning Japanese, you can build a highly rewarding and prestigious career that will
                                lead to a new chapter in your life. <br>
                                Now is the time to decide—take the first step toward transforming your career.
                                Opportunities in Japan await you!

                            <p>
                                I’d love to share my journey of almost six years of experience as a Mongolian software
                                engineer in Tokyo. My path to securing a job in Japan was somewhat unconventional in
                                that I applied for jobs in Japan through career fairs at my graduate school, the Indian
                                Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB).<br><br>

                                Job Hunting <br>
                                I pursued a graduate degree for two years at IITB in Mumbai, India, specializing in
                                Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). As a graduate student at IITB, the job-hunting
                                process was both straightforward and stressful. Like many universities, we had career
                                fairs where companies such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Palantir, SAP, and many
                                others, along with Japanese companies like NTT, Yahoo Japan, Konica Minolta, Softbank,
                                and Mercari, actively sought out new graduates before graduation.<br><br>

                                The application process involved several stages:<br>

                                Submitting resumes to interested companies.<br>
                                Passing an online coding test.<br>
                                Technical interviews with team managers, which could include multiple rounds.<br>
                                Final interview focused on behavioral and culture-fit assessments with the hiring
                                manager.<br><br>
                                The interviews were tightly scheduled and conducted in a competitive environment.
                                However, students from the IITB Computer Science and Engineering department have a
                                nearly 100% success rate in securing jobs, and almost all of them received and accepted
                                offer letters within 1-2 days of completing the process.<br><br>

                                I focused on applying to Japanese companies for several reasons: there are short, direct
                                flights between Japan and Mongolia, both countries are similar in having four seasons,
                                Japan has diverse food choices, and there is also a warm Mongolian community. Most
                                importantly, Japan’s high-tech industry adopts advanced technologies, which offers great
                                opportunities for me to apply my research effectively.<br><br>

                                After completing rounds of interviews, I received an offer from Konica Minolta in Tokyo,
                                Japan. I was thrilled about the opportunity to start my career in a multinational
                                technology company. One concern was fitting in, especially knowing that English is not
                                the primary language (although Japanese wasn’t mandatory for our company, it was more
                                encouraged). So I began learning Japanese.<br><br>

                                Japanese Language<br>
                                I am deeply appreciative of the support my employer provided to help me get to a
                                conversational level of Japanese after I completed my degree. They provided me with
                                full-time, intensive study for 3 months in Ho Chi Minh city, where I attended classes
                                from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. to study for and pass the JLPT N4 exam. Daily one-on-one
                                conversations with my teachers prepared me for the cultural nuances awaiting me.<br><br>

                                My company had initiated the visa process while I was studying Japanese, so after I
                                completed my course, I needed to return to Mongolia to receive my visa and then fly
                                straight to Japan.<br><br>

                                Working in a Corporation <br>
                                In Tokyo, the sight of professionals in suits and carrying briefcases during rush hour
                                is a common one that you might have seen on TV. The corporate culture is characterized
                                by well-structured divisions, large-scale projects, and busy schedules.<br>

                                I was in the IoT department, where I worked on a variety of R&D projects. The great part
                                was that my department is like a small startup within a big company. My colleagues were
                                open-minded and proficient in English. However, fluency in Japanese was essential for
                                broader, cross-departmental contributions, such as participating in the project’s
                                early-on ideating processes. As most long-term projects involve many departments, I had
                                a chance to work with sustainability and manufacturing teams to develop a
                                data-collecting system for the factory.<br>

                                My role involved research into IoT technologies and coding across various projects. I
                                was fortunate to contribute to an award-winning project aimed at driving the company’s
                                digital transformation. This experience provided insights into how major corporations
                                make global decisions to make technological progress. As our company has undergone a
                                significant shift into digital transformation across its global branches, extending
                                beyond Japan, I have come to recognize the pivotal role of R&D in a company’s success.
                                The allocation of funding to develop high-impact innovative ideas is just as crucial as
                                staying competitive in the rapidly evolving tech industry.<br>

                                I gained experience through working on a variety of projects not only as an IoT engineer
                                but also as a backend, full-stack, and frontend developer. While this breadth of
                                experience looked amazing on my resume, I wanted to specialize in a particular platform
                                or programming language. My interest in entrepreneurship led me to volunteer for startup
                                projects to help a broader audience and understand their pain points.<br>

                                At the beginning of the pandemic, our team adopted a remote working culture, where we
                                were only required to go to the office once or twice a week, which helped familiarize me
                                with remote work practices.<br>

                                The working culture of the company was significantly different than what I experienced
                                at KhanBank, one of Mongolia’s largest corporations. I noticed that my Mongolian
                                colleagues tended to invest heavily in personal relationships. We celebrate birthdays,
                                visit each other’s homes during Tsagaan Sar (Lunar New Year), and share hobbies outside
                                of work. In contrast, my Japanese colleagues tended to maintain formal relationships,
                                with less emphasis on personal interactions outside of the workplace.<br>

                                I learned that if someone loves order, structured management, and the pursuit of
                                long-term career goals, the corporate world would be a perfect place for them.<br><br>

                                Working in a Startup <br>
                                One day, I was contacted by the COO of a thriving startup company in Tokyo via LinkedIn
                                to discuss my work experiences and plans, including potential job changes. After a
                                couple of interviews with the team and C-level executives, I received an offer for a
                                frontend engineer position. The projects I worked on before aligned with the skills that
                                were needed at the new company, so it was a perfect match and personally a great place
                                to specialize in Typescript and Vue.js. <br>

                                The environment was very different compared to the corporate world. The first thing I
                                remember was I didn’t need an employee ID to enter or exit the office, and team members
                                seemed easygoing. <br>

                                On my first day, I went to the office to receive my work laptop, greeted my colleagues,
                                and had lunch with them. By the second day, I started working fully remotely, which
                                continued until September 2023. <br>

                                Our company developed an AI-driven solution to predict people’s recommended sizes for
                                online purchases. Our small, dedicated team works tirelessly to assist hundreds of
                                thousands of individuals in finding perfectly fitting clothes online. This experience
                                provided me with insights into the importance of startup agility and the critical role
                                of teamwork in achieving success. Even though the company was only established around 10
                                years ago, I learned that succeeding in the competitive Japanese startup ecosystem
                                requires years of dedication, hard work, teamwork, and solid investment
                                partnerships.<br>

                                Working with people from more than 10 different countries daily was a life-changing
                                experience that allowed me to learn, grow, and contribute to our shared goals. If
                                someone thrives in diverse, open-minded, and fast-paced environments, then a startup is
                                an ideal fit for them.<br><br>

                                Communities for Software Engineers <br>
                                As a foreigner in bustling Tokyo, I always aspire to network with like-minded people to
                                learn, share my experiences, and help others grow. Tokyo’s wide international network of
                                engineering professionals is full of interesting, talented folks open to supporting each
                                other and sharing various volunteer opportunities. For example, check out these tech
                                meetups in Tokyo.<br>

                                Additionally, Mongolian working professionals in Japan have established a community to
                                support knowledge-sharing events and workshops. We have a Facebook group to share IT and
                                software engineering trends, upcoming events, and discuss job-related topics. I had the
                                incredible opportunity to speak at an event organized by Start Japan, where I shared my
                                personal experience of building a remote team to tackle education reform and its
                                challenges in Mongolia. It’s inspiring to connect with fellow Mongolian professionals
                                and witness how they thrive in culturally diverse societies, each striving to do their
                                best. <br>

                                Companies like GerTech and Start Japan recruit volunteers, organize events, and conduct
                                interviews with successful professionals. You can stay updated by following them on
                                LinkedIn or Facebook. Additionally, the Onigiris in Tokyo podcast offers insights into
                                lifestyle, career growth, and experience living in Japan as a Mongolian. <br>

                                As remote work became the norm, it was essential for me to have ways to connect with
                                others and stay informed about the latest tech trends, and these communities provided
                                many meaningful connections for further collaboration. <br><br>

                                Final Thoughts <br>
                                Japan is a great place to learn and experience the power of team collaboration and its
                                impact on a national level. I’ve also been able to appreciate some of life’s simple
                                pleasures here, like sipping matcha, admiring sakura, and embracing gatherings in the
                                park. <br>

                                Many companies here are welcoming talented professionals from abroad. Language is less
                                of a barrier now, especially in tech positions, which opens doors to many
                                opportunities.<br>

                                Also, Japan is an amazing country for families to relocate to, as there are options for
                                some visa types to get dependent visas for spouses and children. Settling in quiet
                                suburbs around Tokyo allows one to both advance their career and also explore the
                                country’s beauty.<br>
